# Zikrr - GitHub Organization Cloner

## Project Overview

Zikrr is a command-line tool written in Go that allows users to clone an entire GitHub organization's repositories with filtering capabilities. This tool simplifies the process of backing up, migrating, or analyzing GitHub organizations by providing an efficient way to clone multiple repositories simultaneously.

## Core Features

1. **GitHub Authentication** - Securely authenticate with GitHub using personal access tokens
2. **Organization Repository Discovery** - List all repositories within a GitHub organization
3. **Interactive Selection** - Choose which repositories to clone through an intuitive CLI interface
4. **Concurrent Cloning** - Clone multiple repositories simultaneously for improved performance
5. **Multi-branch Support** - Clone all branches from selected repositories
6. **Configurable Output** - Specify where cloned repositories should be stored

## User Flow

1. User authenticates with GitHub using a personal access token
2. User provides a GitHub organization URL/name to examine
3. Zikrr lists all available repositories in the organization
4. User selects which repositories to clone using interactive CLI
5. User specifies the output directory for cloned repositories
6. Zikrr clones all selected repositories with all branches
7. Progress is displayed during the cloning process
8. Summary is provided upon completion

## Task Breakdown

### 1. Project Setup & Infrastructure

- Initialize Go module and project structure
- Set up basic command-line framework
- Create configuration file format and handling
- Implement logging system

### 2. GitHub Integration

- Build GitHub authentication system
- Implement organization repository listing
- Create repository metadata fetching
- Develop branch information retrieval

### 3. User Interface

- Design command-line arguments structure
- Create interactive repository selection interface
- Implement progress reporting for long operations
- Build help and documentation within the CLI

### 4. Git Operations

- Implement repository cloning functionality
- Create multi-branch fetching capability
- Build concurrent operation handling
- Add error recovery for interrupted operations

### 5. Testing & Quality Assurance

- Create unit tests for core functionality
- Build integration tests for GitHub interactions
- Implement error handling and reporting
- Test on different platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)

### 6. Documentation & Distribution
